👋  Hi! This is Meilisearch, an open-source, easy-to-use, blazingly fast, and hyper-relevant search engine built in Rust.

Meilisearch is a young company based in Paris. From the outset, our goal is a simple and intuitive experience for both developers and end-users. To know more about us, you can read our [blog](https://blog.meilisearch.com/).

## 🔎 Meilisearch

Our main repository is [Meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch). The code in this repository is only concerned with  exposing the HTTP API, managing multiple indexes, and handling the update store.

Search and indexation are the domain of our core engine, [milli](https://github.com/meilisearch/milli/), while our [tokenizer library](https://github.com/meilisearch/Tokenizer) handles tokenization.

You can learn more about Meilisearch and its features in our [documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com). 


## 🔗 Integrations 

Our team and community have worked hard to bring Meilisearch to almost all popular web development languages, frameworks, and deployment options. New integrations are constantly in development. Check the complete list in [the integration guides](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides).

## 📚 Documentation 

Our [documentation website](https://docs.meilisearch.com) is hosted in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation).

## 💌 Contact


### Forum 📋

Our preferred method of communication is our forums on GitHub Discussions. Asynchronous long-form discussion communication with minimal repetition.

Your project announcements, support queries, and sweet, sweet praise all belong in the [Meilisearch forum]((https://github.com/meilisearch/Meilisearch/discussions)).


For feature proposals, you can go to the [Product forum](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

### Chat 💬

Prefer the speed and fluidity of chat? Then join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/meilisearch).

We think chat and forum discussions are [highly complementary](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/04/effectively-using-discourse-together-with-group-chat/), happily co-existing as two different modes of conversation. Try to use the right tool for the job, but most importantly, we just want to hear from you, regardless of the medium!

### GitHub issues 🔩

Bugs should be reported as issues in the corresponding repository, e.g., [meilisearch/Meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/Meilisearch/issues), [meilisearch/documentation](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues), and so forth.

## 🛡️ Security

Meilisearch takes the security of our software products and services seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Meilisearch-owned repository, please report it to us as described in our [security policy](https://github.com/meilisearch/.github/security/policy).
