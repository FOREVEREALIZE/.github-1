👋  Hi! This is Meilisearch, an open-source, easy-to-use, blazingly fast, and hyper-relevant search engine built in Rust.

Meilisearch is a search engine created by [Meili](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/companies/meilisearch), a software development company based in France and with team members all over the world. Want to know more about us? Check out our [blog](https://blog.meilisearch.com/)!

## 🔎 Meilisearch

Our main repository is [Meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch). The code in this repository is only concerned with  exposing the HTTP API, managing multiple indexes, and handling the update store.

Search and indexation are the domain of our core engine, [milli](https://github.com/meilisearch/milli/), while our [tokenizer library](https://github.com/meilisearch/Tokenizer) handles tokenization.

You can learn more about Meilisearch and its features in our [documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com).
